Over the past weeks, a large part of the world was affected by COVID-19, also known as ‘the Coronavirus’. In many of the affected countries containment measures have been taken, often requiring people to work from home. In some countries there is now a state of emergency and people are confined to their homes. In the Netherlands there’s no state of emergency (yet), but people are urged to work from home as much as possible. Being an asthmatic myself, I’ve been practicing ‘voluntary social distancing’ for a few weeks now. I’ve been avoiding gatherings of people in general, and obviously also worked from home. It’s not unusual for people in my line of work to work from home from time to time, and ‘WFH days’ have been part of my life for years. The WFH days have proven to be great days to really get my head down and get things done with little to no distractions. Spending 4 hours per day in public transit also will take its toll on a person, so regular WFH days also count as a bit of self-care.

But working from home full time is a bit of a different animal. And as a result of the COVID-19 situation, we get to find out just how different. In this first ‘COVID-19 blog’ I’ll share my experiences from the past few weeks; the first week being fully remote in a non-remote team, then gradually moving towards a fully remote team.

So what did I learn?
