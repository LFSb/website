After our succesful first [meetup about Kubernetes](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/Skyworkz/events/260371240/), we have planned the next meetup. This time with more focus on programming. We will start with a talk about how to change architecture in production while at the same time migrating to the cloud. Sven Rienstra, one of our Cloud Developers, will talk about his experience at [majestic.co.uk](https://majestic.co.uk), where he was involved in migrating [nakedwines.com ](https://nakedwines.com) from a monolith into microservices running in the cloud.

After a short break, Mikhail Vaysman will explain 3 different concurrency models: threads and locks, communicating sequential processes and the actor model. He will give code examples and explain when to use which model.

The meetup will begin at 18:00 with food and drinks, and we will wrap up at around 21:15 with some beers. The location is our office, see the [contact](/contact) page for details.
