  We're always looking for awesome Cloud developers and engineers to join us. Take a look at these two roles and let us know if you're up for a cup of coffee!

profiles:

  - name: Cloud Engineer
    text: >
      You are:

       * **passionate** about building scalable and reliable cloud platforms for developers.
       
       * constantly **balancing pragmatism and quality**. You hate blocking developers, and you're not a ticket ticker.
       
       * able to communicate the advantages of the cloud to both business and techies. 
       
       * the go-to person when it comes to the cloud.

       * a polyglot **developer/scripter** and would almost call yourself a programmer: Bash, Python, Go, Perl (just joking, no not Perl).

       * a problem solver. There is no type of infrastructure that you haven't **automated**, no application that you haven't **dockerized**.

       * allergic to the word **DevOps**: another inflated buzzword. It's all about **collaboration, communication and automation**. No need for buzzwords.

      You did:

       * work with cloud based **CI/CD** solutions (for example Github, Gitlab, Google Container Builder, AWS Codebuild or Azure DevOps).

       * containerize your own desktop (just kidding, why on earth would you do that? Leave that up to Jezzie Frazelle and the likes).

       * **monitor distributed systems** (e.g. Grafana, Prometheus, Cloudwatch, Stackdriver).

       * configure VPC's, create VPN's and segment networks.

       * secure cloud environments using **IAM**, policies and security rules.

       * implement and automate security controls and policies (Open Policy Agent).
       
       * implement **secret management** tools (Vault, AWS Secret Manager and the likes).

       * configure and **tune applications** to run and behave correctly (memory, garbage collection).

      Wait. There is more?

       * It would be great if you have experience in **Site Reliability Engineering**.  

       * You know what **Chaos Engineering** is and you can't wait to implement it somewhere.  

       * And to show off on LinkedIn, it would be nice if you have some AWS/GCP/Azure certificates. But experience is more important.  

      So, you check all the boxes? Awesome, we are speechless. Come join us.

  - name: Cloud Developer

      You are:

       * a seasoned **craftsman** with passion for programming

       * gather requirements from the business and translate them into actionable backlog items

       * able to **architect** and write software that is born for the cloud
       
       * the go-to person when it comes to cloud. There is no cloud service that you don't know off.

       * a **polyglot** Programmer (Java, Scala, Javacript/Typescript, Go, Python), and constantly updating yourself with the latest and greatest languages.

       * a seasoned **VIM** user (just kidding, Emacs or VS Code is also fine).

       * allergic to the words DevOps and Agile. **You just get shit done**, you build it you run it.

      You did:

       * develop web applications **at scale** using containers or serverless technologies on AWS, GCP or Azure.

       * extensively use **serverless** technologies like queues, databases and other services.

       * use **event sourcing** and know what eventual consistency is.

       * split up complex monoliths into separate **microservices** (and no, a microservices is NOT just a containerized application...).

       * focus on the **full stack**, not only on features. If there is a way to optimize the software delivery pipeline, you're the first to jump on it.

       * implement monitoring on an application level (APM, **distributed tracing**)

      Not enough? You also have:

       * solid **networking** knowledge (segmentation, firewalls, loadbalancing), experience with **CI/CD** and troubleshooting distributed systems

       * configured **Kubernetes** the hard way (just kidding, leave that up to Kelsey Hightower and the likes...)

       * a bunch of AWS/GCP/Azure certificates. Just cause they look good on LinkedIn.

      Still think you're up to the task? Then we should talk.
