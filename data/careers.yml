  We're always looking for awesome Cloud developers and engineers to join us. Take a look at these two roles and let us know if you're up for a cup of coffee!

profiles:

  - name: Cloud Engineer
    text: >
      You are:

       * **passionate** about infrastructure and able to communicate and coach the advantages of the cloud to both business, agile teams in **DevOps** cloud development. They get that you get the cloud.

       * You are a polyglot **developer/scripter** and would almost call yourself a programmer: Bash, Python, Go, Perl (just joking, no not Perl).

       * There is no type of infrastructure that you haven't coded, no service deployment that you haven't **automated**.

       * Asking for a strong agile background is superfluous for you. Without agile there is no DevOps.

      You did:

       * Deploy applications with infrastructure as code monitoring and cloud native CI/CD pipelines with AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline, CloudFormation or similar services on Google or Azure.

       * Understand, implement, and automate security controls, secure network segmenting and secrets management in a dynamic (multicloud) environment with AWS IAM, KMS, EC2 Systems Manager, Cognito, SAM, CloudTrail, X-Ray or similar services on Google or Azure.

       * Manage, monitor and fine tune applications optimally.

      Wait. There is more?

       * Experience in Site Reliability Engineering.

       * AWS / GCP/ Microsoft Cloud certifications.

      Check all the boxes? Awesome, we are speechless. Come join us.
