      The public cloud is fundamentally different compared to on-premise infrastructure. Servers and containers are ephemeral, autoscalers take care of the scalability and orchestration is done in code. This requires a different way of working. No more managing pets, but herding cattle.

      By leveraging cloud technologies like containerization and serverless, applications become resilient, responsive and scalable. This enables developers to build cost-effective microservices. But the cost model also changes. And what about privacy, compliance and security? Our engineers can help.

      It's hard to keep up with the innovation pace of the cloud. Every year, hundreds of new services are developed by Amazon, Microsoft and Google. This enables you to leverage innovative cloud services, so your developers can focus on building business value.

      On-premise DevOps requires jacks of all trades to keep things running smoothly. But with the cloud, every developer can work on things like pipelines, monitoring and other non-functionals. The cloud enables true DevOps: your team builds it, runs it and manages it. All without a traditional operations department.
