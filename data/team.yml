      Cloud Engineer

      As a Cloud Engineer, I love improving productivity and efficiency through automation. He's a 
      strong advocate for “everything in code”. It’s his strength to look ahead, and to define solid 
      long-term goals. He gets energy from the challenge of reaching these goals through smaller steps 
      that bring value by themselves. He combines this with his strong engineering background, that 
      ranges from front-end development to backend development and (Cloud) operations.
