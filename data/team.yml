      After having worked as a consultant for several years, Bas switched to the dark side. As the

      knowledge of Cloud and DevOps, and is always in for a good technical discussion.


      In his spare time he likes to spend time with is son Sem, he loves skiing and traveling, and
      he is an occasional sporter (road cycling and mountainbiking in the summer, ice skating in the
      winter).
