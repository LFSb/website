## Contributing

This website makes heavily use of Hugo for the content management. There are some guidelines to follow:

 * Use SASS/SCSS. Don't start modifying the `.css` files, only the `.scss`.
 * Install modules using NPM. This keeps our source repository clean.
 * Use Bootstrap as much as possible. Bootstrap is pretty powerfull.
